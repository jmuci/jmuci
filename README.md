# José M. Mucientes Fayos

Senior / Staff-level **Android + Backend Product Engineer**  | **13+ years of experience** | **Colorado, USA**
Kotlin everywhere. Systems thinker. Zero-to-one builder.

> I build products end-to-end — from Android UI to backend services — with a strong bias toward experimentation, iteration, and measurable impact.

---

## What I Do

- 📱 **Android (Kotlin, Compose, Coroutines, Flow, Hilt)**
    
- ⚙️ **Backend (Ktor, JWT auth, Postgres, Exposed ORM, Docker, Microservices, K8s)**
    
- 🔄 API design & client-server contract modeling
    
- 📊 Product experimentation & behavioral metrics
    
- 🧠 Systems thinking with a product-first mindset
    

I’ve spent over a decade building high-scale consumer and creator tools, most recently working across Android and backend systems to ship features that moved engagement, retention, and revenue.

## How I Think

- Build fast, but protect irreversible decisions.
  
- Optimize for learning velocity in early-stage products.
    
- Instrument everything.
    
- Design for extensibility, not overengineering.
    
- Tie technical decisions directly to business impact.
    

I’m especially interested in:

- Commerce systems
    
- Pricing & payments infrastructure
    
- AI-augmented developer workflows
    
- Product-led growth loops

## Currently

- Building side projects with Kotlin + AI-assisted workflows
    
- Exploring agentic systems and commerce automation
    
- Open to interesting zero-to-one product challenges
